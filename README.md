This code is part of Master thesis work, it is written to vertically interpolate
CMIP5 dataset on model level (hybrid sigma/heights level) to pressure level.

It also includes some rountines to Prepare CMIP5 simulation output to e.g: 
yearly files, seperate variables  select box of area under consideration.

Many thanks to @KlemensBarfus :)
